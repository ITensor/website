#Measure the properties of an MPS wavefunction#

Here we'll learn how to measure some properties of the
Heisenberg model wavefunction by adding to the code from the [[previous example|recipes/basic_dmrg]].
Essentially we need three pieces to take an expectation value of some property:  
the operator corresponding to that property, the wavefunction, and a way to do the inner
product of the operator with the wavefunction.

For example, consider trying to measure the z-component of
the spin on some site `j` in the Heisenberg chain.  
This operator is a method of the `SpinOne::Model model(N);` class
that we defined last time, and can be represented by an ITensor:

<code>
ITensor szj_op = model.sz(j);
</code>

Likewise there are operators for the site `j` spin raising (S+) and lowering operators (S-),
methods `sp(j)` and `sm(j)`, respectively.
Now there is an efficient way to take the inner product of these local operators with the MPS
wavefunction. To do this, we must first call the function

<code>
psi.position(j);
</code>

_This step is absolutely vital_.  It tells the MPS wavefunction to put all the information
about the amplitudes of the various spin occupations into the site at `j`.
Without which, measuring `sz(j)` would give errors.  Getting these amplitudes is
then very simple, and they will form the ket part of our Dirac "bra-ket" inner product:

<code>
ITensor ket = psi.AA(j);
</code>

After calling `psi.position(j)`, all the `psi.AA(j+n)` for `n != 0` are basis functions
for the sites `j+n`.  As basis functions, these `psi.AA(j+n)` do
not have amplitude information; only the `psi.AA(j)` does.  That is why it is vital to call 
`psi.position(j)` before doing a measurement at site `j`.

To get the bra part of the Dirac bra-ket, think about the ket as a column vector, the operator
as a matrix, and the bra as a row vector.  We get the bra by turning the ket into a row vector and conjugating
any imaginary parts.  The way we do this is simple:

<code>
ITensor bra = conj(primesite(ket));
</code>

The `primesite` function is what turns the ket into a row vector, and `conj` does the conjugation.
(For the Heisenberg model, there isn't a need for the conjugation, though.)
Now we are ready to measure the expectation value of `sz(j)` by using the inner product function `Dot`:

<code>
Real szj = Dot(bra, szj_op*ket);
</code> 

Let's do another, more complicated measurement that will require our kets to be representing information
on two sites `j` and `j+1`.  The vector product S(j) dot S(j+1) will do just fine.  In terms of the 
z-component and raising and lowering operators, S(j) dot S(j+1) = `sz(j)*sz(j+1) + 0.5*( sp(j)*sm(j+1) + sp(j+1)*sm(j) )`.
For example, one of the operators we'll need is

<code>
ITensor spm_op = model.sp(j)*model.sm(j+1);
</code>

To represent the wavefunction for two sites, we simply call the `bondTensor` method of the wavefunction:

<code>
ITensor bondket = psi.bondTensor(j); 
</code>

The method `psi.bondTensor(j)` is analogous to `psi.AA(j)`, except that 
`bondTensor` encodes bond information between `j` and `j+1`, so long as `psi.position(j)` has been called previously.
The `bondbra` is made the same as the `bra` from earlier:

<code>
ITensor bondbra = conj(primesite(bondket));
</code>

And expectation values are realized in the same way:

<code>
Real spm = 0.5*Dot(bondbra, spm_op*bondket);
</code>

Below you'll find a complete code for measuring properties of the MPS wavefunction.  
The code writes to file a list of Sz(j) and S(j) dot S(j+1) for plotting.
