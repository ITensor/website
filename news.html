<h3>ITensor Version 2.0 Released</h3>
<h2>(Mar 25, 2016) </h2>
<p>
The latest release of ITensor comes with a major overhaul of ITensor and IQTensor internals.
Tensor storage is now handled by a set of independent storage types, which can have completely
arbitrary layouts and behaviors. This paves the way for future support for even more sparse
tensor types, in addition to the currently support ones such as diagonal tensors. For example,
"combiners" are no longer a separate type, but are now just a special case of an ITensor
or IQTensor with "combiner storage".
</p>

<p>
The new version also includes a new low-level linear algebra library as a foundation for ITensor.
This library revolves around a simple tensor type with indices having a fixed order.
Matrices and vectors are treated as special cases of tensors.
</p>

<p>

Miles Stoudenmire will present two lectures, 1.5 hours each, with
hands-on demos of ITensor. Please register or notify your students about this opportunity to discuss details
of ITensor with Miles in person and to attend a great summer school with many distinguished speakers.

<h3>ITensor Version 1.1&mdash;C++11 and more</h3>
<h2>(May 16, 2015) </h2>
<p>
Spring brings another new release of ITensor (<a href="https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor" target="_blank">Github link</a>).
Version 1.1.0 is the first to require C++11 compiler support, which allows us to make the library nicer to use and more
memory safe. The internals have been reworked for better efficiency and stability. 
</p>

<p>
This release also brings a major new feature: AutoMPO. The AutoMPO class makes it simple to create MPOs for many common Hamiltonians, including
on two-dimensional lattices (see the front page for an example of usage). AutoMPO is also quite useful for creating
other MPOs which are sums of local operators. For more details about this release, see the <a href="docs.cgi?page=changelog#v1.1.0">changelog</a>.

<h3>Should you use periodic boundary conditions with DMRG?</h3>
<h2>(Apr. 28, 2014) </h2>
<p>
Are periodic boundary conditions the best way to eliminate edge effects? Aren't correlation function measurements the "standard" and best
approach to detecting symmetry breaking? The answer may surprise you. Fully periodic boundary conditions impose a steep cost within DMRG,
and one can make the case that they are needed only in rare circumstances.
Open boundaries can even be a superior choice for other numerical methods such as quantum Monte Carlo.

<h3>Parallelizing DMRG Across Real Space</h3>
<h2> (Apr. 22, 2013) </h2>

<p>
Although DMRG is a one-dimensional method, its power and efficiency have made it surprisingly effective for studying two-dimensional
lattice models. Recent DMRG results for the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6034/1173.abstract" target="_blank">kagome lattice antiferromagnet</a> have reinvigorated the 
search for realistic quantum spin liquids. DMRG was also the workhorse behind new sophisticated <a href="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.067208" target="_blank">measurements</a> of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphys2465" target="_blank">topological order</a>.
But two-dimensional DMRG calculations are computationally very demanding.
</p>
<p>
DMRG's success in 1d and 2d can be attributed to its ideal characteristics including robust convergence and exponential scaling of accuracy with 
computational cost.
Yet one feature it lacked was parallelism, where a single DMRG calculation could be split across multiple computers.
</p>
<p>
Now this problem has been solved using insights based on matrix product states. Performing a 
matrix product state gauge transformation at the real-space boundary between two blocks provides an orthonormal
basis for independent DMRG calculations within each block, then a way to merge the results afterward.
Repeating this procedure across N blocks enables a single DMRG calculation to run almost N times 
faster. (See figure above.) Using the ITensor Library made it possible to rapidly develop and test the algorithm;  
all of the demanding benchmark calculations used ITensor as well.

</p>
<p>
Note: although the method was developed explicitly using tensors and matrix product states, 
it should be straightforward to implement in conventional DMRG codes and only requires modifying the DMRG algorithm at block boundaries.

<h3>Studying Density Functional Theory in a 1D Laboratory</h3>
<h2> (Aug. 22, 2012) </h2>

<p>
At the heart of the enormously successful density functional theory (DFT) method lies a functional that gives the ground state energy of any system provided only its density. Can this exact energy functional be written down? What are its key properties?
</p>
<p>
Except for a handful of small systems, computing the exact functional in three dimensions is too difficult to permit a systematic study of its properties. 
However, a recent <a href="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.056402">paper</a> in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> 
shows that in one dimension&mdash;thanks to the power of density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations 
and the flexibility of the ITensor Library&mdash;one can calculate the exact densities of a wide variety of continuum, long-range interacting systems 
consisting of long chains of artificial atoms. 
</p>
<p>
From these exact densities, it is relatively straightforward to calculate the exact density functional and a host of other quantities of interest in DFT. 
In the future, this 1d laboratory should be useful for studying popular density-functional approximations and exploring improved functionals which could be applied to strongly correlated systems in 3d.

<h3>Majorana Fermions Thrive in the Hostile World of Electrons  </h3>
<h2> (Sept. 19, 2011) </h2>
<img src="majorana.png">
<p>
Recently, there has been a surge in proposals to observe exotic 
fractional particles known as Majorana fermions using rather 
conventional condensed matter systems. Producing and controlling 
these particles would be a key step toward building a robust quantum 
computer. In one of the simplest setups, Majorana fermions could be 
produced by applying a magnetic field to certain superconducting nanowires. 
But our present theoretical understanding leaves out many of the 
complications expected in a realistic nanowire experiment. 
</p>
<p>
In a recent <a href="http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v84/i1/e014503">paper</a> 
produced using extensive ITensor Library simulations, we take the important step 
of reintroducing the fact that electrons repel one another. The key issue 
is the extent to which the Majorana fermions survive these more realistic 
conditions. Although we find that electron interactions make them more fragile 
to thermal fluctuations, interactions ultimately result in a net gain since 
they make the Majoranas more robust to electron density fluctuations and allow 
them to appear at weaker magnetic fields - the latter two issues being 
more pressing experimentally. In fact, we go so far as to show that a 
magnetic field may not be necessary at all given the right combination of 
materials properties and strong interactions.
